A lightweight, open-source Firefox extension to manage your [Deluge](https://deluge-torrent.org/) BitTorrent client directly from your browser. A complete modern fork of the original [Remote Deluge](https://github.com/YodaDaCoda/chrome-deluge-remote), fully rebuilt for Manifest V3 with themes, icon packs, password encryption, and vanilla JS.

> This is the Firefox port. The Chrome version is at [deluge-remote-modern](https://github.com/TSA3000/deluge-remote-modern).
